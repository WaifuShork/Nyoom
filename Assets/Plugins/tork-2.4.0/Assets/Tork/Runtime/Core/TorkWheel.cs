/*
 * NOTE (A)
 * A car with wheels of diameter ~55cm usually has axle of diameter 2.2cm. That's a ratio of 25.
   Could not get values of real cars to verify the 55 and 2.2 cm claim but hat's what I've read somewhere 
   in a physics problem. This gets me good results. For example: A Civic has 170Nm of torque, at the first 
   gear that's about 530Nm of torque after transmission with a gear ratio of 3.1. If I set the max toque 
   in the motor at 530, I get an acceleration that I'd expect when someone in a Civic floors it.

   I'd imagine heavier vehicles have thicker axles, but their wheels are also large, so may be the 
   ratio would still hold. Or maybe it won't. Please change the value as you prefer.
